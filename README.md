# IP Subnetting and Routing in Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of IP subnetting and routing for a network consisting of four different departments using Cisco Packet Tracer. The initial IP address assigned was a Class B type, which was divided into four sub-networks to accommodate the distinct requirements of each department. By borrowing two additional bits from the host portion, we successfully transformed the network into a classless IP address scheme.

## Subnetwork Configuration

Each of the four sub-networks was allocated a unique network ID, allowing us to assign IP addresses to devices and servers within those networks efficiently. We utilized three routers to interconnect the sub-networks, ensuring effective communication and data transfer between them. The configuration of each router's ports was meticulously executed based on the specific sub-network they were connected to, with the gateway IP address assigned for seamless integration.

## Routing Protocol

To facilitate packet transfer among the routers, we implemented the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). This protocol was configured on each router, enabling them to communicate effectively and manage routing tables dynamically.

## Web Browsing Capabilities

Additionally, web browsing capabilities were integrated for the departments that required them, necessitating the setup of two dedicated servers for HTTP and DNS services. To streamline IP address assignment within the sub-networks, a DHCP server was configured, allowing devices to automatically receive IP addresses as needed.

## Conclusion

This project showcases practical skills in network design and configuration and highlights the importance of subnetting and routing protocols in modern networking. The hands-on experience gained through this project is invaluable for understanding real-world network management and operation.
